# Project 4 - *TweedleTwo*

**TweedleTwo** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Current Issue

I'm spending quite a bit if time trying to implement a class that holds the API public and private key, along with using .gitignore to make sure my private key stays private. This is causing issues with many files not updating or being tracked correctly, in addition to the few files I don't want tracked / updated'. I'm working to resolve this issue'
